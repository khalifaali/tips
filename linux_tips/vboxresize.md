How to Resize an VirtualBox VirtualDisk for Ubuntu ( MacOS)
---

1. On host machine navigate to the VirtualBox directory so that we can run the virtualbox manager command
   
   >`cd /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/Resources/VirtualBoxVM.app/Contents/MacOS/`

2. Now in the proper directory, youâ€™re ready to run the resize command with the following syntax:
   > `VBoxManage modifyhd --resize [new size in MB] [/path/to/vdi]`

    Example

   > `VBoxManage modifyhd --resize 30000 ~/Documents/VM/Windows10.vdi`

3. To double check the the change has taken place execute the showinfo command
    > `VBoxManage showhdinfo ~/path/to/vmdrive.vdi`

4. Now log into the guest Ubuntu machine and open the terminal. 
5. This will open the parted command prompt if you do not have it run 
   `sudo apt install parted`. Now Execute the following commands to resize the partiton
   >`parted`
   
   * If you're prompted with a message to Fix your hard drive accept with the "Fix" option.

   * confirm partion sizes
   >`print`

    * Now to enlarge the partition use
   >`resizepart`

   * Now select which partiton you'd like to resize. Then enter the space in megabytes i.e 1000 = 1G, 10000 = 10G
    
    Example
    >(parted) resizepart \
Partition number? 1\
End?  [10.0GB]? 15000
  
6. You can confirm with `print` again.
7. Now we need to extend the filesystem to use the new partiton lenghth. You will need the partiton you enlarged for this.
8. Execute the following
   >`resize2fs <partition>`

    Example
    > `resize2fs /dev/sda2`

9. Now you're done you can confirm the space has been added by running `df -h `
